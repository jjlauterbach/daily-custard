                <h2>What is Daily Flavors?</h2>
                <p>Daily Flavors is a free service that aggregates the "Flavor of the Day" information from popular frozen custard shops in one convenient place. Instead of visiting multiple websites to find out what's being served today, you can check Daily Flavors and see everything at a glance.</p>

                <h2>Supported Locations</h2>
                <p>We currently track daily flavors from these frozen custard establishments:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Culver's</strong> - Multiple locations in the Milwaukee area</li>
                    <li><strong>Kopp's Frozen Custard</strong> - A Wisconsin institution since 1950</li>
                    <li><strong>Oscar's Frozen Custard</strong> - Local favorite</li>
                    <li><strong>Murf's Frozen Custard</strong> - Family-owned classic</li>
                    <li><strong>Bubba's Frozen Custard</strong> - Community favorite</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We're always looking to add more locations! If you'd like to suggest a shop, please reach out.</p>

                <h2>How It Works</h2>
                <p>Our system automatically checks each shop's website daily to gather the current flavor information. This data is then compiled and displayed in an easy-to-read format. The information is refreshed each morning to ensure you always have the latest flavors.</p>

                <h2>Data Accuracy</h2>
                <p>While we strive to provide accurate information, please note that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Flavors may occasionally change after our daily update</li>
                    <li>Some shops may run out of certain flavors during the day</li>
                    <li>We recommend calling ahead for special occasions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All flavor information is sourced directly from the official websites of each establishment. We are not affiliated with any of these businesses.</p>
